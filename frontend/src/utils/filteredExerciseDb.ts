It is a beginner-level exercise that can be modified to suit different fitness levels and goals. The wall push-up is a modified version of the traditional push-up that reduces the weight-bearing load on the upper body, making it easier to perform. Here are detailed instructions on how to perform the push-up (wall) exercise:\n\n1. Stand facing a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands placed on the wall at shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Engage your core and lower your body down towards the wall, keeping your body straight and your core engaged.\n\n3. As you lower your body, bend your elbows and allow them to flare out to the sides.\n\n4. When your chest touches the wall, press back up to the starting position, straightening your arms.\n\n5. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of reps. Aim for 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps.\n\nIt's important to maintain proper form while performing the push-up (wall). Make sure to keep your body straight and your core engaged throughout the exercise. Avoid letting your hips sag or your head drop. If you feel any discomfort or strain in your upper body, stop the exercise immediately. As you become stronger, you can gradually increase the difficulty of the exercise by moving your hands farther away from the wall or by performing the exercise on an incline or decline."

    exerciseInstructions:
      "The exercise you described, \"barbell standing bradford press\" is not a common exercise and there are different variations that may be called \"Bradford press\" so It would be difficult to provide accurate instructions without more information.\n\nA standard Bradford press is a shoulder exercise that is commonly done with dumbbells and it's a variation of the military press, it's named after the professional bodybuilder Bill Bradford who popularized the exercise. The exercise targets the deltoids, specifically the middle head of the deltoid muscle. Here's how to perform the Bradford press:\n\n1. Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand and hold them at your shoulders.\n2. Press the dumbbells overhead while keeping your elbows in and slightly out to the side.\n3. Lower the dumbbells by bringing them back down to the shoulders, but instead of going all the way down, you bring them behind the head. \n4. Press the dumbbells back up overhead, to complete one rep.\n\nAs for the barbell variation, It's not a widely used exercise. However, if you still want to try it, it would involve performing the press with a barbell instead of dumbbells and it would require a squat rack for support. I would advise you to consult with a trainer or a coach before attempting it to make sure you have proper form and technique, as well as being aware of your limitations.\n"

    exerciseInstructions:
      'The exercise you described, "barbell standing ab rollerout," does not seem to be a commonly used exercise and I can\'t find a standardized movement associated with it. An Ab roller is a fitness equipment that is typically used to work the core muscles, especially the rectus abdominis. The standing version can be a variation, but I would suggest consulting a trainer or coach before attempting it and making sure you have enough knowledge of how to properly use it, as well as proper form and technique to perform the exercise and avoid any risk of injury.\n\nA more common variation that involves using a barbell with ab rollouts is called the "barbell rollout" and it does involve a standing position. Here are detailed instructions on how to perform the barbell rollout:\n\n1. Start by loading a barbell with the desired weight and setting it on the floor.\n2. Kneel down on the floor, placing the barbell in front of you.\n3. Place your hands on the barbell, using an overhand grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n4. Keep your back straight and brace your core.\n5. Slowly roll the barbell forward, extending your arms while keeping your core and lower back engaged.\n6. Continue to roll the barbell out until your arms are fully extended in front of you.\n7. Pause briefly in the extended position, then reverse the movement by pulling the barbell back to the starting position.\n8. Repeat the movement for the desired number of reps.\n\nIt\'s important to note that this exercise can put a lot of stress on the lower back, if you have any history of back issues or if you\'re not use to it, is advisable to start with a light weight and progress gradually. Also, proper form and technique should be followed at all times and it is highly recommended to have the guidance of a trainer or coach before attempting the exercise.\n'

Begin pedaling in a forward motion, using your legs to push and pull the pedals.\n\n5. Keep your core engaged and your back straight as you pedal.\n\n6. Continue pedaling for several minutes, taking breaks as needed.\n\nHere are a few tips to keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to keep your feet aligned with the pedals and your body balanced on the machine to avoid injury.\n\n- If you're new to the cross trainer, start with a lower resistance level and gradually increase it as you build up your endurance.\n\n- Don't lean too far forward or back as you pedal, and try to keep your upper body relaxed.\n\nI hope these instructions help! If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to ask."
